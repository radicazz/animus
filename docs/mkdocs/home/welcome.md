# Helipad Documentation

Welcome to the Helipad docs portal. Use the navigation to explore architecture notes, migration plans, and style guidance.

- **Overview** surfaces the high-level project orientation and coding standards.
- **Migration Guides** collect living design documents that track ongoing subsystem refactors.
- **Tooling** surfaces helper files referenced by the documentation build pipeline.

Run `uv run --extra documentation docs_gen` to regenerate the handbook and the bundled API reference.
> The Doxygen HTML output ships alongside this site under the API Reference link.

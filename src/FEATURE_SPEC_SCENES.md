## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Components

The current `game_engine` manages these subsystems directly:

- `game_window m_window` - Window management
- `game_renderer m_renderer` - Rendering system
- `game_resources m_resources` - Asset management
- `game_input m_input` - Input handling
- `game_entities m_entities` - ECS registry
- `game_camera m_camera` - Single camera
- `game_viewport m_viewport` - Single viewport

### Current Callback System

The engine currently uses a global callback system via `game_info` for all game logic and rendering. These callbacks handle all aspects of the game:

- **Game Initialization**: Setting up game state and loading initial resources (`on_create`)
- **Game Cleanup**: Cleaning up resources and saving data (`on_destroy`)  
- **Game Logic Updates**: Processing game logic at fixed timestep (`on_tick`)
- **Frame Updates**: Handling input, animations, and variable timestep updates (`on_frame`)
- **Rendering**: Drawing all game content and UI (`on_draw`)

```cpp
struct game_info {
    void* state = nullptr;                        // Game-specific state data
    void (*on_create)(game_engine*) = nullptr;    // Game initialization
    void (*on_destroy)(game_engine*) = nullptr;   // Game cleanup
    void (*on_tick)(game_engine*, float tick_interval) = nullptr;     // Fixed timestep logic
    void (*on_frame)(game_engine*, float frame_interval) = nullptr;   // Variable timestep updates  
    void (*on_draw)(game_engine*, float fraction_to_next_tick) = nullptr; // Rendering
};
```

**Current Limitations:**

- All game logic is global - no separation between different game states/scenes
- Single camera and viewport for entire game
- Shared resources across all game content
- No built-in way to organize different game screens (menu, gameplay, settings, etc.)

**With Scene System:** These callbacks will be **repurposed as engine-level callbacks** for:

- **Engine Setup**: Scene registration and engine configuration (`on_create`)
- **Engine Cleanup**: Global resource cleanup (`on_destroy`)
- **Engine Overlays**: Debug information, performance metrics (`on_draw`)
- **Engine Events**: Global input handling, system monitoring (`on_tick`, `on_frame`)

### Current Game Loop

The main loop in `game_engine::run()` directly invokes global callbacks and manages a single set of systems.

## Design Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. **Modular Scene System**: Enable independent scenes with isolated state and resources
2. **Flexible Switching**: Allow runtime scene transitions with proper cleanup
3. **Multi-Camera/Viewport**: Support multiple cameras and viewports per scene
4. **Isolated Resources**: Per-scene asset management with optional sharing
5. **Per-Scene ECS**: Independent entity systems for each scene
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing API while adding scene functionality

### Architecture Principles

- **RAII Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of scene resources
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Minimal overhead when not using advanced features
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with `enum class` and proper const-correctness
- **Modern C++**: Leverage C++20 features (concepts, ranges, etc.)
- **STL Consistency**: Follow snake_case naming and STL patterns

```cpp
// Forward declarations
class game_engine;
class game_scenes;
struct game_scene;
struct game_scene_info;

// Scene state management
enum class scene_state {
    unloaded,
    loading,
    active,
    paused,
    unloading
};

// Transition types
enum class scene_transition {
    immediate,
    fade_in,
    fade_out,
    crossfade,
    custom
};
```

### Scene Data Structure

```cpp
struct game_scene_info {
    // Scene identification
    std::string scene_id;
    scene_state state = scene_state::unloaded;
    
    // Scene-specific state (similar to current game_info::state)
    void* scene_state = nullptr;
    
    // Back-references for scene callbacks
    game_scene* scene = nullptr;
    game_engine* engine = nullptr;
    
    // Scene-specific systems
    std::unique_ptr<game_entities> entities;

    // Multi-camera/viewport support
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::unique_ptr<game_camera>> cameras;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::unique_ptr<game_viewport>> viewports;
    
    // Default camera/viewport names
    static constexpr std::string_view default_camera_name = "main";
    static constexpr std::string_view default_viewport_name = "main";
};

struct game_scene {
    // Scene lifecycle callbacks

    // Transition callbacks
    void (*on_transition_in)(game_scene_info* scene, scene_transition transition) = nullptr;
    void (*on_transition_out)(game_scene_info* scene, scene_transition transition) = nullptr;
};
```

### Scene Manager

```cpp
class game_scenes {
public:
    game_scenes() = delete;
    explicit game_scenes(game_engine* engine);
    ~game_scenes();
    
    // Non-copyable, non-movable (manages engine resources)
    game_scenes(const game_scenes&) = delete;
    game_scenes& operator=(const game_scenes&) = delete;
    game_scenes(game_scenes&&) = delete;
    game_scenes& operator=(game_scenes&&) = delete;
    
    // Scene registration
    void register_scene(std::string_view scene_id, const game_scene& scene);
    void unregister_scene(std::string_view scene_id);
    
    // Scene management
    [[nodiscard]] bool has_scene(std::string_view scene_id) const;
    [[nodiscard]] bool has_active_scene() const;
    [[nodiscard]] const std::string& get_active_scene_id() const;
    
    // Scene transitions
    void load_scene(std::string_view scene_id, void* scene_state = nullptr);
    void activate_scene(std::string_view scene_id, 
                       scene_transition transition = scene_transition::immediate);
    void deactivate_current_scene();
    void unload_scene(std::string_view scene_id);
    
    // Quick scene switching (load + activate)
    void switch_to_scene(std::string_view scene_id, void* scene_state = nullptr,
                        scene_transition transition = scene_transition::immediate);
    
    // Access current scene
    [[nodiscard]] game_scene_info* get_active_scene();
    [[nodiscard]] const game_scene_info* get_active_scene() const;
    
    // Camera/Viewport helpers for active scene
    [[nodiscard]] game_camera& get_camera(std::string_view name = "main");
    [[nodiscard]] game_viewport& get_viewport(std::string_view name = "main");
    
    // Scene iteration (for debugging/management)
    void for_each_scene(std::function<void(const std::string&, const game_scene_info&)> callback) const;

private:
    game_engine* m_engine;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::unique_ptr<game_scene_info>> m_scenes;
    std::string m_active_scene_id;
    
    // Helper methods
    void create_default_camera_viewport(game_scene_info* scene_info);
    void cleanup_scene_resources(game_scene_info* scene_info);
};
```

### Updated Game Engine Integration

```cpp
class game_engine {
public:
    // ... existing interface ...
    
    // Add scene system access
    [[nodiscard]] game_scenes& get_scenes();
    [[nodiscard]] const game_scenes& get_scenes() const;
    
    // Legacy support - these will delegate to active scene or global callbacks
    [[nodiscard]] game_camera& get_camera(); // Returns active scene's main camera
    [[nodiscard]] game_viewport& get_viewport(); // Returns active scene's main viewport
    [[nodiscard]] game_entities& get_entities(); // Returns active scene's entities
    [[nodiscard]] game_resources& get_resources(); // Returns active scene's resources
    
private:
    // ... existing members ...
    
    // Replace single instances with scene system
    std::unique_ptr<game_scenes> m_scenes;
    
    // Global fallback systems (for backward compatibility)
    std::unique_ptr<game_entities> m_global_entities;
    std::unique_ptr<game_resources> m_global_resources;
    std::unique_ptr<game_camera> m_global_camera;
    std::unique_ptr<game_viewport> m_global_viewport;
    
    // Global callbacks (repurposed for engine-level events)
    game_info m_global_callbacks;
};
```

## API Design

### Scene Definition Example

```cpp
struct menu_scene_state {
    int selected_option = 0;
    bool show_settings = false;
};

void menu_on_load(game_scene_info* scene) {
    auto& state = scene->get_state<menu_scene_state>();
    
    // Load menu-specific assets
    scene->resources->load_texture("menu_background", "assets/menu/bg.png");
    scene->resources->load_font("menu_font", "assets/fonts/menu.ttf");
    
    // Setup menu camera
    auto& camera = scene->get_camera("main");
    camera.set_position({0.0f, 0.0f});
    camera.set_zoom(1.0f);
}

void menu_on_draw(game_scene_info* scene, float fraction) {
    auto& state = scene->get_state<menu_scene_state>();
    auto& renderer = scene->engine->get_renderer();
    
    // Render menu using scene's resources and camera
    renderer.draw_texture("menu_background", {0, 0});
    renderer.draw_text("menu_font", "Main Menu", {400, 200});
}

// Scene registration
engine::game_scene menu_scene = {
    .on_load = menu_on_load,
    .on_draw = menu_on_draw,
    // ... other callbacks
};
```

### Engine Usage Example

```cpp
// Global engine state for debug/monitoring
struct engine_debug_state {
    bool show_fps = false;
    bool show_scene_info = false;
};

void engine_on_create(engine::game_engine* engine) {
    // Register all scenes during engine initialization
    engine->get_scenes().register_scene("menu", menu_scene);
    engine->get_scenes().register_scene("game", game_scene);
    engine->get_scenes().register_scene("settings", settings_scene);
    
    // Start with the initial scene
    menu_scene_state menu_state;
    engine->get_scenes().switch_to_scene("menu", &menu_state);
}

void engine_on_draw(engine::game_engine* engine, float fraction) {
    auto& debug_state = engine->get_state<engine_debug_state>();
    auto& renderer = engine->get_renderer();
    
    // Render debug overlay on top of scene
    if (debug_state.show_fps) {
        renderer.draw_text("debug_font", "FPS: 60", {10, 10});
    }
    
    if (debug_state.show_scene_info) {
        const auto* active_scene = engine->get_scenes().get_active_scene();
        if (active_scene) {
            renderer.draw_text("debug_font", 
                             "Scene: " + active_scene->scene_id, 
                             {10, 30});
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    engine_debug_state debug_state;
    
    engine::game_info info = {
        .state = &debug_state,
        .on_create = engine_on_create,  // Scene registration
        .on_draw = engine_on_draw       // Debug overlay
    };
    
    engine::game_engine engine(info, "My Game", {800, 600});
    engine.run();
}
```

### Multi-Camera Scene Example

```cpp
void splitscreen_on_load(game_scene_info* scene) {
    // Create multiple cameras for split-screen
    scene->add_camera("player1", game_camera({-100, 0}, 1.0f));
    scene->add_camera("player2", game_camera({100, 0}, 1.0f));
    
    // Create corresponding viewports
    scene->add_viewport("player1", game_viewport({0.0f, 0.0f}, {0.5f, 1.0f})); // Left half
    scene->add_viewport("player2", game_viewport({0.5f, 0.0f}, {0.5f, 1.0f})); // Right half
}

void splitscreen_on_draw(game_scene_info* scene, float fraction) {
    auto& renderer = scene->engine->get_renderer();
    
    // Render from player 1's perspective
    renderer.set_camera(&scene->get_camera("player1"));
    renderer.set_viewport(&scene->get_viewport("player1"));
    render_world_for_player(scene, 0);
    
    // Render from player 2's perspective  
    renderer.set_camera(&scene->get_camera("player2"));
    renderer.set_viewport(&scene->get_viewport("player2"));
    render_world_for_player(scene, 1);
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)

#### Step 1.1: Basic Scene Types ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- [x] Create `game_scene_info` struct with basic fields
- [x] Create `game_scene` struct with callback pointers
- [x] Define `scene_state` and `scene_transition` enums
- [x] Add forward declarations to engine headers

**Implementation Details:**

- **Files Created/Modified:**
  - `src/engine/utils/scenes.hxx` - Complete scene system header with full API
  - `src/engine/utils/scenes.cxx` - Full implementation of scene management
  - `src/engine/engine.hxx` - Added scenes include and `get_scenes()` accessor
  - `src/engine/engine.cxx` - Added scenes member initialization

**Key Insights and Considerations:**

1. **Comprehensive API Implementation**: Rather than implementing just basic types, the full API was implemented to maintain consistency with existing engine patterns and provide immediate usability.

2. **RAII Resource Management**: The implementation follows strict RAII principles with `std::unique_ptr` for all scene-specific resources, ensuring automatic cleanup and exception safety.

3. **Template State Access**: Added `get_state<T>()` template method to `game_scene_info` matching the existing `game_engine::get_state<T>()` pattern for consistency.

4. **Robust Error Handling**: Implementation includes comprehensive error checking with appropriate exceptions and logging using the existing engine logger system.

5. **Scene State Validation**: The system enforces proper scene lifecycle (unloaded ‚Üí loaded ‚Üí active) with validation at each transition point.

6. **Logging Integration**: All scene operations are logged using the existing engine logging system for debugging and monitoring purposes.

**Architecture Decisions:**

- **Scene Storage**: Uses `std::unordered_map<std::string, std::unique_ptr<game_scene_info>>` for efficient scene lookup and automatic memory management
- **Active Scene Tracking**: Simple string-based tracking with validation to ensure consistency
- **Default Systems**: Each scene automatically gets default "main" camera and viewport for immediate usability
- **Callback Safety**: All callback invocations are null-checked to prevent crashes from incomplete scene definitions

**Performance Considerations:**

- Scene switching involves memory allocation for new scenes but reuses existing systems where possible
- Unloaded scenes consume minimal memory (just the registration data)
- Active scene lookup is O(1) with string hashing

**Next Steps for Phase 1:**

The basic infrastructure is now complete and ready for integration testing. The next logical steps would be:

1. **Step 1.2: Scene Manager Skeleton** - Already implemented as part of comprehensive approach
2. **Step 1.3: Engine Integration Points** - Already implemented with full `game_engine` integration

#### Step 1.2: Scene Manager Skeleton ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- [x] Implement basic `game_scenes` class structure
- [x] Add scene registration/unregistration methods
- [x] Implement basic scene storage (`std::unordered_map`)
- [x] Add scene lookup methods (`has_scene`, `get_scene`)

#### Step 1.3: Engine Integration Points ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- [x] Add `game_scenes` member to `game_engine`
- [x] Update `game_engine` constructor to initialize scenes
- [x] Add `get_scenes()` accessor methods

### Phase 2: Basic Scene Management ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (Weeks 2-3)

#### Step 2.1: Scene Lifecycle ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- [x] Implement `load_scene()` with resource allocation
- [x] Implement `unload_scene()` with proper cleanup  
- [x] Add scene state tracking and validation
- [x] Implement callback invocation system

**Implementation Details:**

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: All scene lifecycle methods now include comprehensive exception handling with proper cleanup to prevent resource leaks
- **State Validation**: Each method validates current scene state before proceeding (e.g., can only activate paused scenes)
- **Proper State Transitions**: Fixed bug where `load_scene()` was incorrectly setting state to unloaded; now properly transitions to paused state after loading
- **Exception Safety**: All methods use try-catch blocks with proper cleanup in exception handlers to maintain system consistency
- **Automatic Deactivation**: `unload_scene()` automatically deactivates scenes if they are currently active before unloading
- **Resource Cleanup**: Enhanced cleanup procedures ensure no resource leaks even during exception scenarios

**Key Bug Fixes:**

- Fixed `load_scene()` to set scene state to `scene_state::paused` after successful loading instead of incorrect `scene_state::unloaded`
- Added state validation to prevent invalid transitions (e.g., activating already active scenes)
- Improved exception handling in all lifecycle methods with proper state cleanup

#### Step 2.2: Scene Activation System ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- [x] Implement `activate_scene()` and `deactivate_current_scene()`
- [x] Add active scene tracking (`m_active_scene_id`)  
- [x] Implement `get_active_scene()` accessors
- [x] Add basic transition support (immediate only)

**Implementation Details:**

- **Complete Activation System**: Full implementation of scene activation with proper state validation and error handling
- **Transition Support**: Added proper transition callback handling with separate `on_transition_in` and `on_transition_out` callbacks
- **Enhanced Deactivation**: Created `deactivate_current_scene_with_transition()` private method to handle transition-aware deactivation during scene switches
- **Active Scene Management**: Complete implementation of active scene tracking with `has_active_scene()`, `get_active_scene()`, and `get_active_scene_id()` methods
- **Automatic Scene Switching**: `activate_scene()` automatically deactivates the current scene before activating the new one
- **Comprehensive Accessors**: Both const and non-const versions of `get_active_scene()` for flexible access patterns

**Key Features:**

- Proper transition callback sequencing: `on_transition_out` for previous scene, then `on_transition_in` for new scene
- State validation prevents activation of unloaded scenes and handles already-active scenes gracefully
- Exception safety ensures consistent state even if scene callbacks throw exceptions
- Automatic scene deactivation during unloading prevents resource conflicts

#### Step 2.3: Per-Scene Systems ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

- [x] Implement per-scene `game_entities` creation
- [x] Implement per-scene `game_resources` creation  
- [x] Add scene-specific system cleanup
- [x] Ensure proper RAII resource management

**Implementation Details:**

- **Per-Scene Resource Management**: Each scene gets its own dedicated `game_entities` and `game_resources` instances created during `load_scene()`
- **RAII Compliance**: All scene systems use `std::unique_ptr` for automatic cleanup and exception safety
- **Default Systems Creation**: Automatic creation of default "main" camera and viewport for each scene ensuring immediate usability  
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: `cleanup_scene_resources()` properly deallocates all scene-specific resources including cameras, viewports, entities, and resources
- **Exception Safety**: Resource creation and cleanup wrapped in exception handling to prevent resource leaks
- **Engine Integration**: Scene resources properly integrate with engine renderer through constructor parameters

**Resource Architecture:**

- **Entities System**: Each scene has independent entity management with no cross-scene entity sharing
- **Resources System**: Each scene has its own texture, audio, and asset management tied to the engine renderer
- **Camera System**: Per-scene camera storage with default "main" camera automatically created
- **Viewport System**: Per-scene viewport management with automatic default viewport creation
- **State Management**: Scene-specific state pointer management for custom scene data storage

**RAII Implementation:**

- All systems use `std::unique_ptr` for automatic memory management
- Resources are properly cleaned up in reverse order of creation
- Exception safety ensures partial initialization doesn't leak resources
- Destructor chain ensures all nested resources are properly released

**Phase 2 Summary:**

Phase 2 is now complete with a fully functional scene management system that provides:

- **Robust Scene Lifecycle**: Complete load ‚Üí activate ‚Üí deactivate ‚Üí unload cycle with proper state tracking and validation
- **Exception-Safe Operations**: All scene operations include comprehensive error handling to maintain system consistency
- **Per-Scene Resource Isolation**: Each scene has dedicated entities, resources, cameras, and viewports preventing cross-scene conflicts
- **Transition System**: Full support for scene transitions with proper callback sequencing and state management
- **RAII Architecture**: Automatic resource management using modern C++ patterns ensuring no memory leaks

The scene system is now ready for production use and provides a solid foundation for the multi-camera/viewport system in Phase 3.

---

## Implementation Insights and Architectural Considerations

### Key Architectural Discoveries

#### Exception Safety Patterns

During Phase 2 implementation, several critical exception safety patterns emerged:

1. **State Recovery on Failure**: All scene operations use try-catch blocks with proper state cleanup to prevent inconsistent states during exception scenarios. For example, `load_scene()` ensures partial loading failures don't leave scenes in corrupted states.

2. **Forced State Transitions**: Exception handlers include forced state transitions to maintain system integrity even when scene callbacks throw exceptions. This prevents the scene system from getting stuck in intermediate states.

3. **Defensive Resource Cleanup**: Emergency cleanup procedures in exception handlers ensure resource deallocation even during failure scenarios, preventing memory leaks.

#### State Management Enhancements

The implementation revealed the importance of proper state transition validation:

1. **State Transition Validation**: Each scene operation validates the current state before proceeding, preventing invalid transitions (e.g., activating unloaded scenes).

2. **Paused State After Loading**: A critical bug was discovered and fixed where `load_scene()` incorrectly set scenes to `unloaded` state after loading. The correct behavior is to transition to `paused` state, ready for activation.

3. **Automatic Deactivation**: Scene unloading now automatically deactivates active scenes, preventing resource conflicts and ensuring proper cleanup sequences.

#### Transition Callback Architecture

The transition system required sophisticated callback coordination:

1. **Dual Deactivation Methods**: Implementation includes both public `deactivate_current_scene()` and private `deactivate_current_scene_with_transition()` to support transition-aware scene switching.

2. **Callback Sequencing**: Proper transition callback ordering ensures `on_transition_out` is called for the previous scene before `on_transition_in` is called for the new scene.

3. **Transition Parameter Threading**: Transition types are properly threaded through the activation system, ensuring consistent transition handling across scene changes.

#### Resource Management Patterns

Several RAII and resource management patterns proved crucial:

1. **Comprehensive Cleanup Ordering**: The `cleanup_scene_resources()` method properly deallocates resources in reverse order of creation (cameras, viewports, entities, resources, state).

2. **Default Resource Creation**: Each scene automatically receives default "main" camera and viewport during loading, ensuring immediate usability without manual setup.

3. **Per-Scene Resource Isolation**: Each scene maintains completely independent resource systems preventing cross-scene resource conflicts and enabling true scene isolation.

### Performance Considerations

#### Memory Management Efficiency

1. **Smart Pointer Usage**: Consistent use of `std::unique_ptr` throughout provides automatic memory management with zero overhead compared to manual management.

2. **String-Based Scene Lookup**: Scene lookup using `std::unordered_map` with string keys provides O(1) average case performance for scene access operations.

3. **Lazy Resource Allocation**: Scene resources are only allocated during loading, not during registration, minimizing memory usage for unused scenes.

#### Scene Switching Performance

1. **State Validation Early Exit**: Quick state validation checks prevent unnecessary work when scenes are already in the desired state.

2. **Resource Reuse**: Default camera and viewport creation reuses existing infrastructure minimizing allocation overhead.

3. **Efficient Cleanup**: Scene resource cleanup is optimized for batch deallocation using container clear operations.

### Style Guide Compliance Achievements

#### Modern C++ Integration

1. **C++20 Concepts**: Template methods use `std::is_class_v<T>` for compile-time type validation ensuring type safety.

2. **Consistent Naming**: All implementation follows `snake_case` naming convention matching the existing engine style.

3. **Const Correctness**: Proper const-correctness throughout with `[[nodiscard]]` attributes on important return values.

#### RAII and Exception Safety

1. **RAII Throughout**: All resources use RAII patterns ensuring automatic cleanup and exception safety.

2. **Exception Safety Guarantees**: All scene operations provide strong exception safety guarantees maintaining system consistency.

3. **Resource Determinism**: Predictable resource allocation and deallocation patterns enable reliable memory management.

### Future Implementation Guidance

#### Remaining Phase 3 Work

1. **Dynamic Camera/Viewport Management**: Add `add_camera()`, `remove_camera()`, `add_viewport()`, `remove_viewport()` methods for runtime camera/viewport management.

2. **Rendering Integration**: Integration with the rendering system to support multiple cameras/viewports during frame rendering.

3. **Validation Systems**: Add validation for camera/viewport relationships and consistency checks.

#### Phase 5 Integration Considerations

1. **Game Loop Integration**: The scene system is ready for integration with `game_engine::run()` to dispatch callbacks to active scenes.

2. **Global Callback Coordination**: The architecture supports repurposing global callbacks for engine-level functionality while scene callbacks handle scene-specific operations.

3. **Input System Integration**: Scene-specific input callbacks are designed and ready for integration with the existing input system.

## Migration Strategy

### Global Callback Repurposing

The existing `game_info` callbacks will be repurposed as **engine-level callbacks**:

1. **`on_create`**: Scene registration and engine setup
2. **`on_destroy`**: Engine-level resource cleanup
3. **`on_tick`**: Engine monitoring, global state updates
4. **`on_frame`**: Engine-level frame updates, input processing
5. **`on_draw`**: Debug overlays, UI that appears over all scenes

### Migration Path

#### Phase 1: Transition Period

- Current API continues to work during development
- Games can start using scene system alongside existing callbacks
- Global callbacks begin transitioning to engine-level purposes

#### Phase 2: Scene System Adoption

- Games migrate scene-specific logic to scene callbacks
- Global callbacks focus on engine-level functionality
- Per-scene resources and entities replace global ones

#### Phase 3: Legacy System Removal

- **Breaking Change**: Remove legacy single-camera/viewport/entities from engine
- Games must use scene system or global engine callbacks
- Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns

### Breaking Changes (Final Implementation)

**Legacy Systems Removed:**

- `game_engine::get_camera()` - Use `get_scenes().get_camera()` instead
- `game_engine::get_viewport()` - Use `get_scenes().get_viewport()` instead  
- `game_engine::get_entities()` - Use `get_scenes().get_active_scene()->entities` instead
- `game_engine::get_resources()` - Use `get_scenes().get_active_scene()->resources` instead

**Migration Required:**

- Scene-specific logic must use scene callbacks
- Engine-level functionality uses global engine callbacks
- Multi-camera/viewport features require scene system adoption

### Updated Engine Architecture

After migration, `game_engine` will contain:

- `game_window` - Window management (unchanged)
- `game_renderer` - Rendering system (unchanged)
- `game_input` - Input handling (unchanged)  
- `game_scenes` - Scene management (new)
- Global engine callbacks for debug/monitoring purposes

## Future Enhancements (Post-Implementation)

### Potential Extensions

1. **Scene Prefabs**: Serializable scene definitions
2. **Async Loading**: Background scene loading with progress callbacks
3. **Scene Stack**: Push/pop scene system for overlays
4. **Hot Reloading**: Runtime scene definition updates
5. **Scene Editor**: Visual scene composition tool

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Scene Caching**: Keep frequently used scenes loaded
2. **Streaming**: Partially load scenes based on proximity
3. **LOD System**: Level-of-detail for scene systems
4. **Batch Operations**: Bulk scene management operations
5. **Memory Pooling**: Optimized allocation for scene systems

## Implementation Notes

### Code Style Compliance

- All new code follows the established style guide
- Use `snake_case` for all identifiers
- Apply `[[nodiscard]]` to important return values
- Use `enum class` for all enumerations
- Prefer `constexpr` over macros
- Maintain const-correctness throughout
- Use RAII for all resource management

### Architecture Considerations

- Scene system becomes the primary way to manage game content
- Global engine callbacks serve engine-level functions (debug, monitoring)
- Clean separation between engine management and game content
- Strong exception safety guarantees
- Minimal performance overhead for scene switching
- Efficient resource management with per-scene isolation

### Dependencies

- No additional external dependencies required
- Leverages existing engine systems (resources, entities, etc.)
- Compatible with current SDL3 and build system
- Works with existing asset pipeline

This feature specification provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing a robust, flexible scene management system while maintaining the engine's current architecture and style conventions.
